{"name":"Localytics Data Viz Challenge","tagline":"Randy Olson's submission","body":"# Where would BootLoader users fund Dennis Ridesalot's bike project?\r\n\r\n## Task description\r\n\r\nBootLoader is a mobile app that helps people crowdfund their creative projects. Anyone with an idea, dream, and 2-minute video can post their project on BootLoader. Others then donate money to the project to help bring it to fruition.\r\n\r\nDennis Ridesalot, a BootLoader user, has a new concept for a 3-speed bicycle made from recycled parts with a $20 price point. The BootLoader team wants to send a push notification to their users, prompting them to fund the project. However, they don't want to send a message to all of their users--only those who they think would be interested.\r\n\r\nThat's where you come in. You're the resident data expert at BootLoader. You'd like to create a visualization that helps answer: what kinds of users would be interested in the bicycle project?\r\n\r\nLuckily, you've been collecting analytics data on how your users fund projects. You also have software that can send push notification to segments of users, based on attributes like location, age range, gender, and mobile device.\r\n\r\nFor example, you can send a push notification to all iOS users in Chicago, IL that says \"Deep dish lovers unite! Help fund the largest pizza in the world on BootLoader.\"\r\n\r\n## Initial analysis\r\n\r\nAfter an initial exploratory analysis into BootLoader funding behavior, it became clear that location plays the biggest role in whether a BootLoader user will fund a Sports or Environment project. Although the BootLoader user base has certain demographic biases -- for example, there's a huge user base spread across Illinois, there's far more married users than single users, and there's far more 18-24 year old users than older years -- none of these demographic factors played a significant role in the *rate* at which the users would fund Sports or Environment projects. Therefore, for this visualization I chose to focus on the geographic patterns within the data set.\r\n\r\n## Visualization\r\n\r\nFor this map, I wanted to answer two major questions that would be relevant to Ridesalot's campaign:\r\n\r\n1. Where are people using BootLoader?\r\n\r\n2. Where are people funding Sports and Environment projects?\r\n\r\nTo accomplish this in the visualization, I chose to use dots to represent the geolocations of groups of users. The size of the dot corresponds to the number of users in that part of the U.S., whereas the opacity of the dot corresponds to the percentage of project views that resulted in funded Sports or Environment projects.\r\n\r\n<img src=\"us-map-bike-funding-annotated.png\" />\r\n\r\nNumerous major trends reveal themselves in this map. First and foremost, there are several hubs of BootLoader users throughout the U.S., most of which correspond to major U.S. cities:\r\n\r\n* Los Angeles, California\r\n\r\n* Portland, Oregon\r\n\r\n* Denver, Colorado\r\n\r\n* Houston, Texas\r\n\r\n* Atlanta, Georgia\r\n\r\n* Chicago, Illinois\r\n\r\n* New York City, New York\r\n\r\nIt also appears that BootLoader has attained widespread adoption throughout Indiana. More importantly, several of these hubs -- namely, Portland, Oregon; Denver, Colorado; and Atlanta, Georgia -- tend to see an impressive 50% or more of their Sports and Environment projects ultimately funded when viewed. The areas around Indianapolis also see a good funding rate for Sports and Environment projects, but the user base in Indianapolis is considerably smaller.\r\n\r\n## Conclusions\r\n\r\nTo maximize funding rate while annoying the fewest BootLoader users with unnecessary push notifications, Ridesalot's advertisement should be sent out to BootLoader users in the following cities:\r\n\r\n* Portland, Oregon\r\n\r\n* Denver, Colorado\r\n\r\n* Atlanta, Georgia\r\n\r\n* Indianapolis, Indiana\r\n\r\nThese cities are likely to result in a high funding rate for Ridesalot's project and will be seen by a large user base, thus giving Ridesalot's project the best possible chances at reaching its funding goal.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
